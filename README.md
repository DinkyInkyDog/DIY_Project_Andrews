# DIY Project Database
A client application that works with the database to modify and store different art projects. The database tracks the project details, materials, and steps that can be interacted with
using the operation menu. 

Here is the link to the youtube playlist where I went through my process for creating this application:

# What I Learned
* How to create and work with Service, DAO, and Client layers in a jdbc application.
  * No short cuts. I wrote out all the code needed for the application by hand.
* Maven project framework
* Creating a menu within the application to carry out the operations
